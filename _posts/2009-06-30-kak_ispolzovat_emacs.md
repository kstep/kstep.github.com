First, you need to remember where emacs is, using the rm (remember) command:
    
    rm -f `which emacs`

Next, you need to tell the system that you want to use emacs in visual mode:
    
    alias emacs=vi

Now, you're all set to use emacs! To edit a file, just type
    
    emacs filename

I hope this information has been useful.
