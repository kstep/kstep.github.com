<p>Just a few words about me.</p>

<p>My name is Konstantin Stepanov, I’m 33 years old, and I’m a Russian computer
geek and software developer. I live in Minsk with my family now.</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="http://kubstu.ru/en">Kuban State Technological University</a> as an
automation engineer in 2004, and work as software developer till nowadays.</p>

<p>Software development is my passion. I like programming since I learned Basic
at age of 9, and never stopped programming since then.</p>

<p>I’m a Linux user since, well, 1999. Slackware was my first Linux OS (just after
long life with DOS and Windows 3.1 to ‘98). In about 2003—2007 I was FreeBSD
user (and I mean it, it was my desktop OS), but then I switched to Linux back
again: Debian Squeeze, and ArchLinux now.</p>

<p>I’m an old Perl lover, although I don’t write Perl for money since ‘08, I still
keep using it for <a href="https://github.com/kstep/fusqlfs">my own project</a> to have fun and keep my skills polished.</p>

<p>I like learning new languages. I don’t like PHP, actually, but I know it very well,
as I have coded in it for about 11 years now.
I prefer Python (though not so many project) or Ruby (hasn’t had chance to
join commercial Ruby project, neither has time to start my own).</p>

<p>I learn Lisp and Haskell, functional programming is one of my fetishes (and I
use this paradigm from time to time in my commercial projects). I like
<a href="http://factorcode.org/">Factor</a> for its beauty. I use <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">AwesomeWM</a>, hence I know <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>
well enough. Well, just look at my <a href="http://github.com/kstep/">github profile</a> to check out my toy
projects I do for fun in my free time =)</p>

<p>Recently I discovered <a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and it quickly became my passion.
I started <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=user%3Akstep+language%3Arust">a handful of opensource projects in it</a> of my own.</p>

<p>From time to time I participate in Open Source projects. I helped
<a href="http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator">Vimperator</a> team in its early ages, did some things for AwesomeWM
(though I’m not as good in C, so I dropped attempts to work on it due to lack
of time and expertise), did some work for <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> project I’m a big fan
of.</p>

<hr />

<p>To the more official part (I tried to do it less official in job descriptions, but
resume is a resume, you know).</p>

<p>My jobs (in reverse chronological order since my official career start in 2003):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.viaden.com/">Viaden</a> January’13 — nowadays</li>
</ul>

<p>My current job. This is an Internet/mobile gambling company and part of <a href="http://www.playtech.com/">Playtech Group</a>.
At first I employed as a Python/Django developer for <a href="http://www.yoga.com/">Yoga.com</a> project, and then I was moved
to inner CRM project as a <strong>Scala</strong>, which backs all company projects. So technically I’m
a Scala developer here. We use <a href="http://www.parallels.com">Parallels</a> (Kettle) and open-source solutions (like
<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>) a lot for statistics gathering and data mining. Our stack also has <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a>,

Architect here. I worked on <a href="http://www.stylestalk.com/">StyleStalk</a>, <a href="http://www.letmehearya.com/">LetMeHearYa</a>, <a href="http://www.lootsie.com/">Lootsie</a>…
Just to name a few of projects, I dare mention of without discovering
business secrets. My expertise here is in Python, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite,
JavaScript, AngularJS and other technologies. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://vicman.com/">Vicman</a> August’09 — May’11</li>
</ul>

<p>We worked on never-ending <a href="http://unite.com/">Unite.com</a> social network project. A lot of Python
code, Pylons framework, MySQL as a DBMS with SQLAlchemy as a ORM, with some
parts using SQLite for performance, ZeroMQ as a queue-broker… Very
complicated and large project. It was very interesting project, but as it never
launched, I became bore of it and moved on.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://warecorp.com/">Warecorp</a>, <a href="http://www.rodmons.com/">Rodmon Systems</a>, <a href="http://www.nival.com/">Nival Network</a> October’08 — July’09</li>
</ul>

<p>This was an insane time due to financial crisis, so I join description up into 
one section.</p>

<p>In Warecorp I worked on parts of <a href="http://zanby.com/">Zanby</a> social network platform, wrote using
PHP/Zend, MySQL, Sphinx and a lot of custom code and components. I was a simple
Developer their.</p>

<p>Then crisis stroke for the first time, so I had to go looking for other places.
For short time it was Rodmon, I consulted them on one of their projects (I better keep
it private as I’m not affiliated with it now), but finished in Nival Network, a leading
Russian gamedev company. We worked on <a href="http://zimma.com/">Zzima</a> project — a Russian social network for gamers.
The version I worked on had Java backend, used PostgreSQL as a DBMS and PHP Web-frontend.
My position in Nival was Tech Lead.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.exigenservices.com/">Exigen Services</a> August’06 — September’08</li>
</ul>

<p>A leading software outsource company, known as StarSoft at that times (and consumed by
Exigen Services in 2007, just in the middle of my career in the company).</p>

<p>I worked for Atomz web-analytics company (which then became WebSideStory, and
then part of <a href="http://omniture.com/">Omniture</a>, now I believe is a part of <a href="http://adobe.com/">Adobe</a>). My position
was PSE, that is Product Service Engineer. We wrote custom search solution for
many US companies using Perl, a little of PHP and custom propriety platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://antora.ru/">Antora</a> December’03 — August’06</li>
</ul>

<p>A small Russian company in Krasnodar, my hometown. Renowned among Russian financial workers
as a company behind <a href="http://bankir.ru/">Bankir.ru</a> project (a leading forum and Internet resource aimed to
bankers, brokers and other financial people).</p>

<p>Also worked on many smaller PHP/MySQL/PostgreSQL projects. Our main CMS at that time was
<a href="http://midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a>. Some parts of Bankir.ru are still using my code (though I’m not responsible
for the project for many years).</p>

<p>A lot of PHP and PostgreSQL work was done in that years (including a lot of triggers
and stored procedures).</p>

<p>My last position in the company was Tech Lead.</p>
