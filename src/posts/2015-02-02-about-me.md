title: About me
---

Just a few words about me.

My name is Konstantin Stepanov, I'm 34 years old, and I'm a Russian computer
geek and software developer. I live in Minsk with my family now.

I graduated from [Kuban State Technological University][kubstu] as an
automation engineer in 2004, and work as software developer till nowadays.

Software development is my passion. I like programming since I learned Basic
at age of 9, and never stopped programming since then.

I'm a Linux user since, well, 1999. Slackware was my first Linux OS (just after
long life with DOS and Windows 3.1 to '98). In about 2003—2007 I was FreeBSD
user (and I mean it, it was my desktop OS), but then I switched to Linux back
again: Debian Squeeze, and ArchLinux now.

I'm an old Perl lover, although I don't write Perl for money since '08, I still
keep using it for [my own project][fusqlfs] to have fun and keep my skills polished.

I like learning new languages. I don't like PHP, actually, but I know it very well,
as I have coded in it for about 11 years now.
I prefer Python (though not so many project) or Ruby (hasn’t had chance to
join commercial Ruby project, neither has time to start my own).

I learn Lisp and Haskell, functional programming is one of my fetishes (and I
use this paradigm from time to time in my commercial projects). I like
[Factor][factor] for its beauty. I use [AwesomeWM][awesome], hence I know [Lua][lua]
well enough. Well, just look at my [github profile][github] to check out my toy
projects I do for fun in my free time =)

Recently I discovered [Rust][rust] and it quickly became my passion.
I started [a handful of opensource projects in it][my-rust-github] of my own.
I try to promote the language here, in Minsk, Belarus.

From time to time I participate in Open Source projects. I helped
[Vimperator][vimp] team in its early ages, did some things for AwesomeWM
(though I'm not as good in C, so I dropped attempts to work on it due to lack
of time and expertise), did some work for [AngularJS][ng] project I'm a big fan
of.

* [Warecorp][], [Rodmon Systems][rodmons], [Nival Network][nival] October'08 — July'09

This was an insane time due to financial crisis, so I join description up into
one section.

In Warecorp I worked on parts of [Zanby][] social network platform, wrote using
PHP/Zend, MySQL, Sphinx and a lot of custom code and components. I was a simple
Developer their.

Then crisis stroke for the first time, so I had to go looking for other places.
For short time it was Rodmon, I consulted them on one of their projects (I
better keep it private as I'm not affiliated with it now), but finished in
Nival Network, a leading Russian gamedev company. We worked on [Zzima] project
— a Russian social network for gamers. The version I worked on had Java
backend, used PostgreSQL as a DBMS and PHP Web-frontend. My position in Nival
was Tech Lead.
